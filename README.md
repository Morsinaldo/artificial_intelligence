# Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains files from Artificial Intelligence course at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN).

## Exercise List 1

This list explores Machine Learning fundamentals such as Naive Bayes and Random Forests. In addition, we did two works researched on the Internet to show some applications with these Algorithms:

- [Naive Bayes to detect spam emails](./Exercices%20List%201/Trabalho_01_IA_Naive_Bayes.ipynb)

- [Random forest for weather forecast](./Exercices%20List%201/Trabalho_02_IA_Random_Forest.ipynb)

- [Full List](./Exercices%20List%201/Lista%201%20-%20IA.pdf)

## Exercise List 2
This list explores Deep Learning fundamentals such as Multilayer Perceptron, Convolutional networks, Recurrent networks and LSTM. In addition, we did two works researched on the Internet to show some applications with these Algorithms:

- [MLP to predict loan payment](https://github.com/Morsinaldo/credit_risk_nn)

- [Generative Adversarial Networks](./Exercices%20List%202/Trabalho_02.ipynb)
